<h2>Description of tariff selection</h2>
<p>The selection consists of two steps.</p>
<p>First, you need <%= link_to('to load your call history', customer_history_parsers_prepare_for_upload_path) %>
   (currently only available for MTS, Megafon, Beeline and Tele2)
   or <%= link_to('simulate it', customer_calls_set_calls_generation_params_path) %>. 
</p>
<p>
   Then you can <%= link_to('proceed to the selection of the tariff', tarif_optimizators_main_index_path) %>.
</p>   
<p>
   If you want, you can select a set of operator services (roaming calls, SMS, Internet, etc.) for which it is necessary to
   pick up the tariff. This is useful for the selection of tariffs for mobile phones with two SIM cards.
</p>
<p>
	You can also calculate the cost of mobile communication for the selected tariff and tariff options.
